# **AI-Powered Games**

This is a curated list of games that leverage AI in their game mechanics in some significant way, whether it’s with large language models, text-to-speech, in-game asset generation etc.

This isn’t to be confused with games that were created by AI, although I might include some in this list if there are any notable examples. 

I expect that sometime in the near future the majority of newly released games will incorporate AI/generative AI in some way so eventually this list will become redundant.

Until then I will try to update it maybe if I have time.
